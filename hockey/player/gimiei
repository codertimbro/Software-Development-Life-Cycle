Show drafts


Let's analyze the provided data and identify two players who are likely to have an "Over" on points, an "Under" on PPP (Power Play Points), and an "Over" on shots on goal.

Assumptions:

We're looking for players who have been consistently performing well in 2024.
We'll consider their recent performance and the opponent's defensive strength.
We'll factor in some luck, as it plays a role in individual games.
Potential Picks:

Dylan Larkin (DET):

Points Over 0.5: Larkin has been consistently scoring points this season, and with the Red Wings facing a weaker defensive team, he has a good chance of exceeding 0.5 points.
PPP Under 0.5: While Larkin is a skilled player, his power-play production hasn't been exceptional this season.
Shots Over 2.5: Larkin is known for his shooting ability and tends to fire a lot of shots, making him a good candidate for over 2.5 shots on goal.
Alex DeBrincat (OTT):

Points Over 0.5: DeBrincat has been a consistent scorer for the Senators, and facing a weaker defensive team increases his chances of scoring a point.
PPP Under 0.5: While DeBrincat is on the power-play unit, his production on the power play has been inconsistent this season.
Shots Over 2.5: DeBrincat is a high-volume shooter and often takes multiple shots per game, making him a good bet to exceed 2.5 shots on goal.
Remember:

Hockey is a game of variance: Even the best players can have off nights.
Check for any late-breaking news: Injuries, line changes, or suspensions can significantly impact a player's performance.
Consider the odds: While these players are good picks, it's important to look at the odds offered by different sportsbooks.
Additional Considerations:

Opponent's Defense: If the opponent has a strong defense, it might be wise to consider players facing weaker defensive teams.
Player's Recent Form: Check if a player is on a hot streak or going through a slump.
Matchup History: Look at the player's past performance against the specific opponent.
By carefully considering these factors, you can make informed decisions when placing bets on NHL player props.

Certainly, let's analyze the provided data on Power Play Points O/U.

Observations:

Over 0.5: Most players have a higher probability of going "Over" 0.5 Power Play Points. This is evident from the lower odds associated with the "Over" option for most players.
Under 0.5: Only a few players have a significant chance of going "Under" 0.5 Power Play Points. This is indicated by the much higher odds associated with the "Under" option for these players.
Potential Picks:

Based on the odds and the general trend, the following players could be considered for potentially going "Under" 0.5 Power Play Points:

Moritz Seider: The "Under" option has a very high probability, suggesting a low chance of him scoring a Power Play Point.
Max Domi: Similar to Seider, the "Under" option has a very high probability, indicating a low likelihood of him scoring a Power Play Point.
Oliver Ekman-Larsson: The "Under" option has a high probability, suggesting a low chance of him scoring a Power Play Point.
Remember:

Hockey is a game of variance: Even players with low odds of scoring a Power Play Point can still do so.
Check for any late-breaking news: Injuries, line changes, or suspensions can significantly impact a player's performance.
Consider the odds: While these players are good candidates for going "Under," it's important to look at the specific odds offered by different sportsbooks.
Additional Considerations:

Opponent's Penalty Kill: If the opponent has a strong penalty kill, it might reduce the chances of the player scoring a Power Play Point.
Player's Recent Form: Check if a player has been scoring Power Play Points consistently or if their production has been inconsistent.
Matchup History: Look at the player's past performance against the specific opponent.
By carefully considering these factors, you can make informed decisions when placing bets on NHL Power Play Points props.

Custom Functions:

1. GetRotationImpact():
```vba
Function GetRotationImpact()
    Dim impact As Double
    impact = 1
    
    'Check back to back games
    If DaysRest = 0 Then
        impact = impact * VLOOKUP(Team, RotationPatterns, 2, FALSE)
    End If
    
    'Check 3 games in 4 nights
    If Is3in4() Then
        impact = impact * VLOOKUP(Team, RotationPatterns, 3, FALSE)
    End If
    
    'Check rotation type
    Select Case VLOOKUP(Team, RotationPatterns, 6, FALSE)
        Case "Strict": impact = impact * 1.02
        Case "Variable": impact = impact * 0.98
        Case "Matchup": impact = impact * GetMatchupAdjustment()
    End Select
    
    Return impact
End Function
```

2. CalculateFinalPrediction():
```vba
Function CalculateFinalPrediction()
    'Base projection
    Dim base As Double = SeasonAvg * (MinutesTrend/32) * (PaceFactor/100)
    
    'Adjustments
    base = base * DefenseAdjustment()
    base = base * MatchupHistoryImpact()
    base = base * RefereeImpact()
    base = base * RotationImpact()
    base = base * LineMovementSignal()
    
    'Recent form weight
    base = base * 0.7 + Last5Avg * 0.3
    
    Return Round(base, 1)
End Function
```

3. CalculateConfidence():
```vba
Function CalculateConfidence()
    Dim score As Integer = 0
    
    'Sample scoring criteria
    If LineMovement > 0 Then score += 1
    If SharpAction = "Yes" Then score += 2
    If MatchupAdvantage > 0 Then score += 1
    If RefereeFavorable Then score += 1
    If RotationAdvantage Then score += 1
    If Value >= 3 Then score += 2
    
    Select Case score
        Case 0 To 2: Return "Low"
        Case 3 To 5: Return "Medium"
        Case Else: Return "High"
    End Select
End Function
```

Would you like me to explain any specific calculations or add any other features? We could potentially add:
- Weather impact for outdoor stadiums
- Arena shooting background analysis
- Travel distance impact
- TV broadcast influence

Also, I could create specific worksheets for:
- Bankroll management
- Unit size calculations
- ROI tracking
- Variance analysis

Let me know if you'd like any of these additions or have other specific metrics in mind!
